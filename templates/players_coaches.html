            <p>Newly appointed Futsal Development Officer Chris Sinclair and Central Football's Antony Riley have travelled to the Continental Futsal Championships in Thailand prior to the 2021 Lithuania Futsal World Cup in September. 

              <br>Here's an update on what their days have been like so far:
              
              <br> <br>Day 8: Matchday 4. Today we moved into the knock out stages of the competition (semi-finals). Antony's first match was Iran vs Uzbekistan (Semi Final 1), in which he was the timekeeper. Following that, Both Antony and I had Semi-Final 2, which was Thailand vs Egypt. The match was fast, physical and played in a very tactical way, with both teams either sitting deep in defence or pressing very high up the court to try and turn the ball over in an attacking area. We used all the tools in our toolbox throughout the match to manage players challenging for space off the ball. We had two situations that required us to use the Video Support that supported the correct on-field decisions during the match, and a penalty was awarded against Egypt. We were able to implement new positioning techniques that helped us control the game. After the match, we returned to the hotel for another PCR Swab test and finished a great day off with a debrief and appointments for matchday 5.
              
              <br> <br>Day 9: Matchday 5 and the final day of the competition. Today we left the hotel and got to the stadium early to support our referee colleagues in the 3rd/4th playoff match and then prepare for our game later in the afternoon. The final was a spectacular match. Played at pace with lots of fast counter-attack transitions from defence to attack. Both teams used various rotations that needed close monitoring, and Thailand required the use of the power play GK. It was a really enjoyable match for both Antony and I to be involved in and topped off another fantastic tournament for us both. The next part of our journey is to complete our 14 days MIQ in the hotel, and once we are released, we will continue to train over here in Bangkok for 3 to 4 weeks. Finally, on the 1st of September, we will arrive in Vilnius (Lithuania) to kick-start our preparations for the FIFA Futsal World Cup 2021.
